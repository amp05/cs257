DATA: The Survivor database is built for fans of the American reality competition 
franchise Survivor and uses contestant data from seasons 1-42.

The data was scraped from Wikipedia and Fandom into a Kaggle dataset by 
Justin Veiner and published with the following link: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinveiner/survivor-cbs-dataset?select=season_table.csv


STATUS: 
Search Contestants: Using this tool, the user can search for any contestant that has 
been featured on seasons 1-42. They may search by any search term, and if that term is
within any contestant's name, they will be included in a table displaying the contestant's
name, age when featured, hometown, occupation, and season number.

Connections: Using this tool, the user can input any two contestant names and get a list of 
contestant connections throughout the seasons.

Diversity Graphs: Using this tool, the user can choose how many seasons they wish to include
in the dataset, then get a resulting table that indicates the counts of diversity indicators
within that dataset (among which are African America, Asian American, and Latin America).
